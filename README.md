Seeing without Eyes- Distributed Vision

Living Pixels is a bio-inspired simulation exploring how global visual patterns can emerge from purely local interactions. The project models a 2D grid of pixel-like agents that adapt their appearance based solely on local environmental sensing and neighbor communication—without any central controller, global image access, or explicit search!

Inspired by the remarkable camouflage abilities of cephalopods such as octopuses and cuttlefish, this simulation investigates how “seeing without eyes” can arise from decentralized biological systems. Cephalopods achieve rapid, high-resolution camouflage using specialized skin cells called chromatophores. Each chromatophore is locally controlled and responds to neural, chemical, and environmental signals, yet together they form coherent, environment-matching patterns across the entire body.

Emergent behavior is a hallmark of many biological systems. This project builds on ideas discussed in my OmniSci Magazine article, “Living Pixels,” which explores chromatophores as biological, color-changing pixels and their potential role in distributed sensing and bio-inspired computation.

Things to add: 
 1. pulsing based on Perlin Noise: I saw an amazing [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxUY42r_6Cg) about how perlin noise is used to make video game graphics more fluid and engaging. it would be fantastic to utilise this for the pulsing instead of a constant parameter. 
 2. turn into a computer vision project using edge detection, and adapt to the patterns intelligently.
